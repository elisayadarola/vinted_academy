trying to get the number of rows in the clcik columns so i can count it since it's not a integer (this was integrated along with other fucntion containing relevant parameters and variables)

def get_number_of_rows(rowe):
    return{"tOTAL_CLICKS":rowe["click_target"].count("")}
print(get_number_of_rows)

FAILED - it either resulted in 0 or it gave me <function get_number_of_rows at 0x101ae5bc0> OR "The count is: <built-in method count of list object at 0x10acb8f80>" after other small changes. 

# checking to see if it gives me clicks only
def get_rows(row):
    print(row.count("row"))

FAILED - TypeError: 'function' object is not iterable


# now I need to count the number of clicks
click_count = 0
for row in get_rows:
    click_count += int(row["Clicks"])
print(f"Total clicks:{click_count}") 
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'ad'
